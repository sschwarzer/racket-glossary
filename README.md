# Racket Glossary

This project hopefully will result in a glossary to be included in the
[Racket](https://racket-lang.org/) documentation to help primarily Racket
beginners and intermediate users understand Racket concepts and interactions
between them.

## Purpose

- Give definitions of terms used in Racket and Scheme in general.

- Help beginning and intermediate users understand terms encountered in the
  Racket documentation. Assume that readers are familiar with imperative
  programming, but not with functional programming, Scheme and Racket.
  Therefore, some entries may contain comparisons with related features in
  other programming languages.

- Provide context. So some entries may have more content than you'd usually
  expect from a glossary.

## Format

I'd like to see this glossary end up in the Racket documentation, so eventually
it needs to be converted to Racket's documentation language
[Scribble](https://docs.racket-lang.org/scribble/). On the other hand, I think
we maybe should use a simpler format like Markdown for easier contributions
until the content is good enough to be included in the Racket documentation.

Therefore, feel free to make contributions either in Markdown or Scribble,
whatever you prefer.

## Contributions

I'm still experimenting with the format and want to write more glossary entries
myself before I settle.

At some point, I'll surely need feedback, especially on the intermediate and
advanced entries.
