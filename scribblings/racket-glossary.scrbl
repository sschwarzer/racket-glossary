@title{Glossary of Racket concepts}
@author{Stefan Schwarzer}

@section{Introduction}

The Racket documentation describes a lot, often very abstract concepts. For someone
starting with the language, it's often not clear which concepts are widely used
and which aren't. It's quite easy to lose one's way by getting distracted by
relatively obscure concepts.

This led to a @(hyperlink
"https://racket.discourse.group/t/learning-racket-scheme-how-do-you-get-to-the-practicing-stage/901"
"discussion") on the Racket forum and during this discussion to the plan to
start this glossary. The intention is to list many concepts, even the obscure
ones, together with their importance, given by these levels:
@itemlist[
  @item{@bold{basic:} These are basic concepts you should know to write Racket
    libraries and programs. If you're starting to learn Racket, focus on these
    concepts.

    Note that ``basic'' here doesn't nessarily mean ``trivial.'' Don't be
    discouraged if you don't understand these glossary entries immediately.
    Experiment with the code examples or revisit the respective glossary entry
    later when you have more Racket experience.}
  @item{@bold{intermediate:} You can write most Racket software without these
    features, but you may need them depending on your problem. One example
    would be threads to execute different tasks concurrently.}
  @item{@bold{advanced:} Likely you won't need these features, but they may
    improve your software. Look into these if you're comfortable with the
    entries in the ``basic'' and ``intermediate'' categories.}]

@; TODO: Improve wording.
Not all Racket users will agree on this categorization and the assigned levels
for individual terms, but the categorization should give you a rough idea
which concepts are more foundational than others.

@section{Entries}

@glossary-entry{Arity}

  @level-basic

The arity describes how many arguments a function can accept. Everything from
zero to infinitely many arguments is possible.

Arity refers only to positional arguments, not keyword arguments.

See also: @secref*["Function" 'glossary] @in-g

@glossary-entry{Assignment}

  @level-basic

@; Binding vs. location?

Assigning means the same as in most programming languages: changing the value
of a variable. To change the value of a variable, use @racket[set!]:
@examples[
  #:eval helper-eval
  (define my-variable 2)
  (displayln my-variable)
  (set! my-variable 5)
  (displayln my-variable)
]

However, in Racket and other functional languages, assignment is used much less
than in imperative languages. The ``normal'' approach in functional languages
is to transform immutable values to other immutable values.

To change a value via assignment, you need a name (binding) and a storage
location for it. Usually, the binding and location are created with
@racket[define], but they can also be created by one of the @racket[let] forms.

See also:
@itemlist[
  @item{@secref*['("Binding" "Let" "Location") 'glossary] @in-g}
  @item{@secref*["set!" 'guide] @in-rg}
  @item{@secref*["set!" 'reference] @in-rr}]

@glossary-entry{Binding}

  @level-basic

A binding makes a value accessible via a name. Typically, bindings are created
with the @racket[define] form:
@examples[
  #:eval helper-eval
  (define x (+ 2 3))]
binds the name @racket[x] to the value @racket[5].

Note that the bound value is the @italic{result} of the expression, not the
expression itself.

See also:
@itemlist[
  @item{@secref*["Binding" 'glossary] @in-rg}
  @item{@secref*["id-model" 'reference] @in-rr}]

@glossary-entry{Boolean}

  @level-basic

Booleans represent truth values. In some other languages this type is called
@code{bool} or @code{boolean}. Racket has two boolean literals:
@itemlist[
  @item{@racket[#f] false}
  @item{@racket[#t] true}]

If a value is interpreted as a condition (as in @racket[if] or @racket[cond] forms),
only the constant @racket[#f] is interpreted as false, all other values are
interpreted as true.

@examples[
  #:eval helper-eval
  (for ([value '(#t 1 0 "false" '() map (void) #f)])
    (displayln (if value "true" "false")))]

See also: @secref*["booleans" 'reference] @in-rr

@glossary-entry{Box}

  @level-intermediate

A box is a container to essentially turn an immutable value into a mutable
value. Passing a box as a function argument is similar to passing a value by
reference in some other languages.

@examples[
  #:eval helper-eval
  (define (func value-box)
    (define old-value (unbox value-box))
    (set-box! value-box (add1 old-value)))

  (define a-box (box 7))
  (func a-box)
  (displayln (unbox a-box))]

As you can see, using boxes is kind of awkward compared to passing arguments by
reference in other languages. However, in practice this isn't a problem since
it's unidiomatic in Racket to use mutable values. Instead you usually transform
immutable values to other immutable values.

@glossary-entry{Closure}

  @level-basic

A closure combines a function with environment data from a scope outside the
function.

@examples[
  #:eval helper-eval
  #:label "Example:"
  (define (make-incrementer increment)
    (lambda (value)
      (+ value increment)))
  (define add3 (make-incrementer 3))
  (add3 5)]

The return value of @racket[make-incrementer] is the closure. The
@racket[lambda] expression doesn't define the increment; the value is taken
from the scope outside the lambda expression.

@glossary-entry{Lambda}

  @level-basic

As shown in the @secref*["Procedure" 'glossary] entry, a procedure can be
defined with @racket[define]. However, you can also define functions directly
as values without giving them a name. This is the same function as in the
@secref*["Procedure" 'glossary] glossary entry:

@examples[
  #:eval helper-eval
  (lambda ([name "world"])
    (string-append "Hello " name "!"))
  ((lambda ([name "world"])
     (string-append "Hello " name "!"))
   "Alice")]

The second example above defines and directly calls the function.

The above examples are a bit artifical. Normally, you use a function defined
with @racket[lambda] as a function argument for a
@secref*["Higher-order_function" 'glossary] or in a @secref*["Let" 'glossary]
expression.

@glossary-entry{Let over lambda}

  @level-intermediate

``Let over lambda'' describes a common idiom to create a closure. The following
example is similar to the one in the @secref*["Closure" 'glossary] entry:
@examples[
  #:eval helper-eval
  #:label #f
  (define add3
    (let ([increment 3])
      (lambda (value)
        (+ value increment))))
  (add3 5)]

Here, @racket[let] creates the outer environent whereas @racket[lambda] defines
the function using that environment.

See also: @secref*['("Procedure" "Lambda" "Closure") 'glossary]

@glossary-entry{List}

  @level-basic

Lists are the most widely used data structure in many functional programming
languages, including Scheme and Racket.

Scheme and Racket lists are implemented as singly-linked lists (with the
exception of the empty list, which is an atomic value). Singly-linked lists
consist of pairs where the first value of a pair is a list item and the second
value of the pair points to the next pair. The end of the list is denoted by an
empty list as the second value of the last pair.

For example, the list @racket['(1 2 3 4)] can be drawn as

@list-pict['(1 2 3 4)]

This data structure looks much more complicated than an array, where items are
stored in adjacent memory locations. A singly-linked list also has the
disadvantage that accessing list items by index requires traversing the list
until the pair with the given index is found.

The reason why lists are still so widely used is that they make it easy to
prepend items without changing the lists other references ``see.''
For example, the code
@examples[
  #:eval helper-eval
  #:label #f
  (define list1 '(1 2 3))
  (define list2 (cons 'a list1))
  (define list3 (cons 'b (cdr list1)))]
creates the following data structures:

@tt{list1}@linebreak[]@list-pict['(1 2 3)]

@tt{list2}@linebreak[]@list-pict['(a 1 2 3)]

@tt{list3}@linebreak[]@list-pict['(b 2 3)]

or, in one picture,

@tt{list2@hspace[7]list1}@linebreak[]
@combined-lists-pict['(a 1) '(b) '(2 3)]@linebreak[]
@tt{@hspace[12]list3}

So each of the lists looks as you would expect, but it's not necessary to make
any copies of the list data. Instead the lists share some data, without this
being visible to code that uses these lists. (An exception is if list items are
changeable values, e.g. vectors, and are actually changed in-place. In that
case, all lists that share this changed data ``see'' the change. But usually
you should avoid mutating data, partly for this reason.)

Changing lists with @racket[cons] maximizes the data that can be shared between
lists. The situation is different if you change data ``further down'' the list.
In this case, it may be necessary to copy a part of the list data.

@examples[
  #:eval helper-eval
  #:label "Example:"
  (define list1 '(1 2 3 4))
  (define list2 (remove 2 list1))]
creates the following structure:

@tt{list1}@linebreak[]
@combined-lists-pict['(1 2) '(1) '(3 4)]@linebreak[]
@tt{@hspace[12]list2}

Note that structure sharing depends only on the used list algorithms (e.g. in
@racket[remove] above). There's no sophisticated algorithm that tries to
``de-duplicate'' common data. For example,
@examples[
  #:eval helper-eval
  #:label #f
  (define list1 '(1 2 3))
  (define list2 '(1 2 3))]
creates two separate list data structures.

Note that Scheme/Racket lists are different from ``lists'' in many other
programming languages. Typically those lists store data in adjacent memory
locations and have a fast append operation. Racket lists, on the other hand,
are singly-linked lists and have a fast @italic{prepend} operation
(@racket[cons]), but @italic{appending} items is rather slow because it has to
iterate through the whole list and make a copy. The closest equivalent in
Racket to the above-mentioned lists in some languages are called growable
vectors (see @racket[gvector]). However, Racket lists are the idiomatic
approach for most list processing, so use them if you can.

@glossary-entry{Location}

  @level-basic

A location is an implicitly created memory location. For example, this happens
in @racket[define] or @racket[let] forms. A consequence of creating a location
is that it can be modified with @racket[set!] or other mutating functions.

@examples[
  #:eval helper-eval
  (define (change-argument arg)
    (displayln arg)
    (set! arg 5)
    (displayln arg))
  (change-argument 3)

  (let ([v (vector 1 2 3)])
    (displayln v)
    (vector-set! v 2 5)
    (displayln v))]

However, usually you should avoid mutation in functional programming.

@glossary-entry{Pair}

  @level-basic

Pairs, also called cons cells, are the building blocks of Scheme/Racket lists,
but are also often used for combining any two values.

Usually a pair is created with @racket[cons]:
@examples[
  #:eval helper-eval
  (cons 1 "one")]

Once a pair is created, you can access the first and second value of the pair with
@racket[car] and @racket[cdr]:
@examples[
  #:eval helper-eval
  (define a-pair (cons 1 "one"))
  (car a-pair)
  (cdr a-pair)]

See also:

@glossary-entry{Parameter}

  @level-basic

@glossary-entry{Partial application and currying}

  @level-basic

Partial application takes a function with some number of arguments and creates
a new function that calls the original function while hard-coding some of the
arguments.

The following example defines a function @racket[draw-line] and a curried
version @racket[draw-line-from-origin], which hard-codes the @racket[from-x] and
@racket[from-y] arguments:

@examples[
  #:eval helper-eval
  #:label #f
  (define (draw-line from-x from-y to-x to-y)
    (code:comment "Keep it simple; just print a string instead of drawing a line.")
    (displayln (format "Drawing a line from (~a, ~a) to (~a, ~a)"
                       from-x from-y to-x to-y)))
  (draw-line 1 2 3 4)
  (code:comment "Hard-code the first two arguments of `draw-line`.")
  (define (draw-line-from-origin to-x to-y)
    (draw-line 0 0 to-x to-y))
  (draw-line-from-origin 2 3)]

Currying is similar, but it hard-codes only one argument and, as long as the
arguments aren't complete, returns a function that @italic{also} takes only one
argument.

For example, if you have a function @tt{curry} that does the initial currying,
the @racket[draw-line] example above could become
@examples[
  #:eval helper-eval
  #:label #f
  (curry draw-line 1)
  ((curry draw-line 1) 2)
  (((curry draw-line 1) 2) 3)
  ((((curry draw-line 1) 2) 3) 4)]

Racket has a function @racket[curry], which supports both partial application
and currying at the same time.
@examples[
  #:eval helper-eval
  #:label #f
  (curry draw-line 1)
  ((curry draw-line 1) 2)
  (((curry draw-line 1) 2) 3 4)]

Note that the last call passes @italic{two} arguments, @racket[3] and
@racket[4].

There's also a function @racket[curryr], which hard-codes arguments from the right
instead of the left of the argument list.

Unlike Haskell, Scheme/Racket doesn't have implicit currying, so the following
code raises an exception:
@examples[
  #:eval helper-eval
  #:label #f
  (eval:error
    (define draw-line-from-origin (draw-line 0 0)))]

@glossary-entry{Procedure}

  @level-basic

A procedure, also called a function, is a value that can be called at program
runtime. If a procedure is used after an opening parenthesis, it introduces a
function call. For example, @racket[add1] is a simple function that adds 1 to
its argument:

@examples[
  #:eval helper-eval
  (add1 2)]

If a function should be called without arguments, it's written @racket[(func)].
Since the parentheses cause the function call, you can't just add brackets around
expressions. For example,

@examples[
  #:eval helper-eval
  (eval:error ((add1 2)))]

calculates @racket[3] through the function call @racket[(add1 2)] and tries to
call the result @racket[3] as a function, @racket[(3)], which gives an error
saying that @racket[3] isn't callable.

On the other hand, when using a function in another position, it's just a
``passive'' value:

@examples[
  #:eval helper-eval
  add1
  (procedure? add1)
  (list add1 add1)]

As using too many brackets, using too few can lead to problems, although they
tend to be less obvious:

@examples[
  #:eval helper-eval
  (define (foo)
    add1 2)
  (foo)]

You might have expected @racket[3] as the result of calling @racket[foo].
However, since the parentheses around @code{add1 2} were missing and the result
of a function is the value of the last expression, the function returned
@racket[2].

Depending on how a function is defined, it can take zero arguments to an almost
unlimited number of arguments (usually done with a special syntax in the
function definition).

The following function takes an optional argument and returns a string to
greet someone:

@examples[
  #:eval helper-eval
  (define (greeting [name "world"])
    (string-append "Hello " name "!"))
  (greeting)
  (greeting "Bob")]

@glossary-entry{Struct}

  @level-basic

Although Racket has an OOP system, the primary way to group information for a
type is using a @racket[struct] and functions related to it.

@examples[
  #:eval helper-eval
  (struct person (name age))]

Here, @racket[person] is the name of the struct and @racket[name] and
@racket[age] are the @deftech{fields} of the struct.

Creating a struct like above creates several bindings. One is for the
name of the struct, which can be used to create instances of the
struct:

@examples[
  #:eval helper-eval
  #:label #f
  (define bilbo (person "Bilbo Baggins" 111))
  bilbo]

Moreover, each field results in a binding named
@italic{@racketidfont{struct-name-field-name}} to access the value of
each field in a given struct instance:

@examples[
  #:eval helper-eval
  #:label #f
  (person-name bilbo)
  (person-age bilbo)]

It's also possible to declare a struct as @deftech{mutable} by adding
a @racketkeywordfont{#:mutable} keyword. This creates additional accessor
functions to set values in a struct instance. However, you usually should
avoid mutation in Racket. Instead, use @racket[struct-copy] to create
a new struct instance based on another instance:

@examples[
  #:eval helper-eval
  #:label #f
  (define younger-bilbo (struct-copy person bilbo [age 100]))
  (person-name younger-bilbo)
  (person-age younger-bilbo)]

See also @secref*["Functional_update" 'glossary]. You can use more
than one field name/value pair.

By default, structs are created as @deftech{opaque}. This means that
printing a struct instance doesn't show the values. More important is
the gotcha that comparing opaque struct instances with @racket[equal?]
compares by @italic{identity} (like @racket[eq?]), @italic{not} by
@italic{field values}!

@examples[
  #:eval helper-eval
  #:label "Example:"
  (define bilbo2 (person "Bilbo Baggins" 111))
  (equal? (person-name bilbo) (person-name bilbo2))
  (equal? (person-age bilbo) (person-age bilbo2))
  (equal? bilbo bilbo2)]

Adding the @racketkeywordfont{#:transparent} keyword to the struct
definition avoids this problem:

@examples[
  #:eval helper-eval
  #:label #f
  (struct person (name age)
    #:transparent)
  (define frodo (person "Frodo Baggins" 33))
  frodo
  (define frodo2 (person "Frodo Baggins" 33))
  (equal? (person-name frodo) (person-name frodo2))
  (equal? (person-age frodo) (person-age frodo2))
  (equal? frodo frodo2)]

Note two things:
@itemlist[
  @item{Printing @racket[frodo] shows the struct values, not just
    @tt{#<person>}.}
  @item{Comparing two struct instances of the same
    @italic{transparent} struct type with the same values with
    @racket[equal?] gives @racket[#t].}]

The latter is not only more intuitive, but it's also very useful when
comparing calculated and expected struct instances in automated tests.

That said, values of @italic{different} struct types compare as
@racket[#f], even if the field names are the same.

Although Racket uses opaque structs for stronger encapsulation and
backward-compatibility, many Racket users nowadays think that defining
structs as transparent usually gives the better tradeoff.

Note that field names are only known at compile time, not at
runtime. This means that a function like Python's
@hyperlink["https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#getattr"]{@tt{getattr}}
doesn't exist in Racket.

Racket vectors are continuous arrays with indices starting at 0. An advantage
of vectors over lists is that accessing a vector item at a random index takes
constant time, i.e. is independent of the vector size and the index.

Literal vectors can be written with a @tt{#(} prefix. Items in literal vectors
are automatically quoted. The following examples use the @racket[vector-ref]
function to retrieve an item at a given index.
@examples[
  #:eval helper-eval
  (code:comment "Simple vector with some numbers.")
  #(1 2 3)
  (code:comment "Empty vector")
  #()
  (code:comment "Items are quoted. This vector does _not_ contain the `map` function.")
  (define vec1 #(map))
  (vector-ref vec1 0)
  (code:comment "Use `vector` to avoid quoting.")
  (define vec2 (vector map))
  (vector-ref vec2 0)]

Vectors can be mutable or immutable. Literal vectors and those created with
@racket[vector-immutable] are immutable. Vectors created with @racket[vector]
are mutable.
@examples[
  #:eval helper-eval
  (define vec1 #(1 2 3))
  (eval:error (vector-set! vec1 1 5))
  (define vec2 (vector-immutable 1 2 3))
  (eval:error (vector-set! vec2 1 5))
  (define vec3 (vector 1 2 3))
  (vector-set! vec3 1 5)
  vec3]

There are several vector functions (e.g. @racket[vector-map] or
@racket[vector-filter]) that correspond to similar list functions. If the
existing vector functions aren't enough, it may make sense to convert a vector
to a list with @racket[vector->list], process the list with list functions and
finally convert the list back to a vector with @racket[list->vector].
